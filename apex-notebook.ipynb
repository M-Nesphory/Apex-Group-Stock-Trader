    "## FORECASTING AFRICAN STOCK MARKETS USING PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS\n",

    "## 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Project Objective\n",
    "Build a model that identifies highly correlated stocks and tracks their performance over time. Integrate NLP-based market intelligence to generate predictive insights that help investors understand market sentiment and anticipate trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "Predictive stock models are common in Western markets, where investors rely on data-driven tools to track correlations and forecast market behavior. African markets lag behind in this area. Many investors lack tools that reveal correlated trends and complex relationships between local stocks. They need a model that combines quantitative market data with qualitative insights from financial news to make informed investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Technical Approach\n",
    "We will primarily use **time series analysis** to track stock values and identify performance patterns.  \n",
    "We will apply **NLP techniques** to process financial news and market reports for **sentiment analysis**, capturing public and media sentiment toward specific stocks or sectors.  \n",
    "Finally, we will use **statistical correlation methods** to cluster stocks that move together, revealing interdependencies and co-movement trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** Historical stock price data and financial news text  \n",
    "**Output:** A set of correlated stock clusters and predictive trend insights\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4 Key Challenge\n",
    "**Sparse Market Data:** Many African stocks lack consistent reporting and media coverage, which limits available market intelligence and can reduce model accuracy. The system must handle incomplete data without losing predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.5 Success Metrics\n",
    "We will evaluate the model using:\n",
    "- **Prediction Accuracy:** 75% (target)  \n",
    "- **Correlation Strength (R²):** Measure of how closely identified clusters move together  \n",
    "- **Sentiment-Performance Alignment:** How well market sentiment predicts price movements  \n",
    "- **Coverage:** Proportion of stocks included in meaningful clusters  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.6 Expected Outcomes\n",
    "The project will deliver a **predictive analytics tool for African markets** that highlights correlated stocks and emerging trends. It will provide insights into **unique stock relationships** across sectors and regions.  \n",
    "The model will remain **interpretable**, not a black box—every prediction will include justification based on underlying data and sentiment indicators."
